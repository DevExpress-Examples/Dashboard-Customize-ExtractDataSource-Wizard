# How to Invoke a Customized Data Source Wizard in the DashboardViewer

This example demonstrates how to customize Data Source Wizard pages and invoke a customized Wizard in the DashboardViewer.

The [ExtractDataSourceUIHelper.EditExtractOptions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.ExtractDataSourceUIHelper.EditExtractOptions(DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardExtractDataSource-DevExpress.DashboardWin.EditExtractOptionsContext)) static method invokes the [Data Source Wizard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/17652/).
To customize the **Edit extract** page, the application uses the approach described in the [How to Customize Views and Presenters Corresponding to Wizard Pages](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/18293/) document.
